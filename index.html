               <h3>How It Started</h3>
               <p>
                  I've always had a love for art, as far back as I can remember. The earliest memory I have of me  drawing is from a valentine I made my mom as a child. We used construction paper, crayons and of course lots of glitter. My mom's favorite color is blue, so that's what I used. Pairing the blue construction paper with half of a red heart with half of a pink heart I glues it to the blue paper, but I wasn't done just yet. Using an elmer's glue squeeze bottle, I painted the words "I love you mom" and sprinkled the blue and white sequenced glitter over top of it. I added glue for a glitter heart at the top of the page (unknowing of how heavy it would be after it dried), and thus my masterpiece was complete. I believe that was the moment that I fell in love with art.

               <h3>My Thoughts</h3>
               <p>
                  In my opinion art is one of the most important aspects in life, as it surrounds us in many ways.Just about everything around us began as a sketch. From cups to homes; from cars to electronics. It consumes our everyday lives without it even being a thought in our mind.

               <h4>How It's Going</h4>
               <p>
                  Art has always been an outlet for me, a way to express myself in a way that words just could't. I draw, I paint, I sew, I cook, I sing, I dance, I speak spanish; just to name a few, and now, I take photos. I've had many experiences of being the person in front of the lens and am currently teaching myself how to be the person behind the lens. I'm just getting started and am using my phone to learn the basics of photo editing before buying a fancy camera. In addition to photography I've decided to challenge myself a little more because, learning one new skill wasn't enough for me, for some reason. Almost simultaneously, with learning photography, I decided to learn to code. They are both forms of art (in my opinion). Photography captures the essence of the subject in front of the lens while coding primes and paints the digital canvas.
